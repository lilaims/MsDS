**Note: transformers in current trend able to handle long sequences 
where the context and dependencies between words play an important role
are better for sentiment analysis

Problem in sentiment Analysis is Classification
Sentiments can be positive , neutral or negative
Challenges:
1. complexity in data pre-processing - high dimensionality
2. uncertainty in classifying sentiment polarities

high dimensionality can be reduced by part of speech tagging
This method transforms textual data into smaller feature sets based on wordsâ€™ part-of-speech category and converts each set of words to a corresponding sentiment polarity score.

--high dimensionality is
significantly reduced, and the information related to sentiment
orientation is greatly preserved

--uncertainity in sentiments
Three-way classification has been studied and applied in various fields to
address uncertainty in decision-making
 In order to determine the threshold for
dividing the three regions, we adopt game-theoretic rough sets
(GTRS) 

--derivation of probabilistic rough set regions
--strucutred probabilistic rough sets

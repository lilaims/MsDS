In natural language processing (NLP), feature extraction is a fundamental task that involves converting raw text data into a format that can be easily processed by machine learning algorithms. There are various techniques available for feature extraction in NLP, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. As a data scientist, itâ€™s important to have a good understanding of the different feature extraction techniques available and their appropriate use cases.

In this article, I will explore several common techniques for feature extraction in NLP, including CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, word embeddings, bag of words, bag of n-grams, HashingVectorizer, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, and Part-of-Speach (POS) tagging.

preprocessing using bigram models

---------------------------------------------
1. Preprocessing using word_token from nltk only
2. use n gram preprocessing check optimization

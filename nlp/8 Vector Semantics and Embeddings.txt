Distributional Hypothesis  



-------------------------
Space
Distributional semantic models differ primarily with respect to the following parameters:

Context type (text regions vs. linguistic items)
Context window (size, extension, etc.)
Frequency weighting (e.g. entropy, pointwise mutual information,[15] etc.)
Dimension reduction (e.g. random indexing, singular value decomposition, etc.)
Similarity measure (e.g. cosine similarity, Minkowski distance, etc.)

Distributional semantic models that use linguistic items as context have also been referred to as word space, or vector space models.[16][17]

Pretrained models, like word2vec, make it easy to get started but may lack
 domain-specific words needed for a high-accuracy text analytics application.

Morphological tagging is the task of assigning labels to a sequence of tokens that describe them morphologically.
As compared to Part-of-speech tagging, morphological tagging also considers morphological features, such as case, gender or the tense of verbs.

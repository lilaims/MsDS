TF IDF

-------------------------
TF-IDF - Term Frequency , Inverse Document Frequency
keyword will be more important if its frequent ina document and infrequent in a dataset
Vectorising inputs according to features
characterise each document as a list of feature value pairs
1. Term frequencies / One hot vector
relative frequency of term t within document d, 
tfidf(t,d,D) = tf(t,d) . idf(t,D)

idf(t,D) = log (N/D)

scikit
tf with with countVectorizer()
tf-idf with tfidfVectorizer()


Unigram , bigram are features , 
anything quantifiable becomes a feature 
like how many punctuation marks

Combining Features
different ranges

Text Summarization
 - Single Document , Multiple Document
 - news, reviews , research papers
 - Extractive , abstractive

Question Answering
 - Information Retrieval
 - Knowledge Based , Hybrid approaches

 - Temporal Reasoning


 -------------------------------------------
Single Doc Summarization

Document -> Content Selection -> Information Ordering -> Sentence Realization -> Summary

Content Selection - Classification  - supervised (Naive Bayes , Maximum Entropy Classifier) 
                                   / Unsupervised (tf-idf for saliency , centrality score)

Feature Extraction 
- Ordering of sentences (Rhetorical Structure Theory) 

Multi Document Summarization
 - based on the same story
 - usually unsupervised , challenge is to get rid of redundancy
 - redundancy removal - maximal marginal relevance
 - cannot keep original order accross documents
 - chronological ordering with time , 
 - parsing and dependencies - open research problem

Evaluation of text summarization
 - extrinsic , intrinsic
 - answering a set of key questions
 - Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)

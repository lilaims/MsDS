The real-world data is often redundant with high dimensions. This poses challenges not only for computational efficiency but also hinders the modelling of the representation. Consider for example, the swiss roll in the figure below. The data is in three dimensions however, when we unroll it, it only required two dimensions to represent the same object. This is called dimensionality reduction and more specifically, dimensionality reduction using manifold learning. The basic assumption here is that the high dimensional data has often a lower dimension embedding which is sufficient to represent the content of the original data.

Memory usage
The memory usage of a Categorical is proportional to the number of categories plus the length of the data. In contrast, an object dtype is a constant times the length of the data.

Sparse
Data where a single value is repeated many times (e.g. 0 or NaN) may be stored efficiently as a arrays.SparseArray.

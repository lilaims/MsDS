Model-based algorithm use the transition and reward function to estimate the optimal policy.
Model-free algorithms find the optimal policy with very limited knowledge of the dynamics of the environment. They do no thave any transition/reward function to judge the best policy.

markov assumption - It assumes that the future state of a process only depends on its current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it

Welcome to Artificial Intelligence in Games. During this module you will learn a range of Artificial Intelligence techniques employed in games, 
as well as how games can be used for research in Artificial Intelligence. During this module you will learn how to program agents to play different types of games in both single and multi-player settings.

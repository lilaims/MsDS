type - Model based , Model free Learning Algorithms
Model-based algorithm use the transition and reward function to estimate the optimal policy.
Model-free algorithms find the optimal policy with very limited knowledge of the dynamics of the environment. They do no thave any transition/reward function to judge the best policy.

markov assumption - It assumes that the future state of a process only depends on its current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it

trial and error

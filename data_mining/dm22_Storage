OLAP vs KQL- Kusto Query Language

-------------------------------------
KQL: KQL operates on semi-structured and structured data, 
allowing users to query and analyze large volumes of data stored in Azure Data Explorer 
or Azure Log Analytics. It's particularly well-suited for analyzing log and telemetry data,
  time-series data, and other types of big data.

OLAP: OLAP systems typically use a multidimensional data model (cube) that organizes data
  into dimensions (categories) and measures (numeric values). Users can perform complex 
  multidimensional analyses such as drill-down, roll-up, slice, and dice operations on this data model.

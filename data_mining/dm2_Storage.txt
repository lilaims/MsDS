-Cube is a shorthand for multidimensional dataset, given that data can have an arbitrary number of dimensions.
  The term hypercube is sometimes used, especially for data with more than three dimensions. 
    A cube is not a "cube" in the strict mathematical sense, as the sides are not all necessarily equal. 
-A Slice is a term for a subset of the data, generated by picking a value for one dimension and only showing the data for that value

**
OLAP data is typically stored in a star schema or snowflake schema in a relational data 
warehouse or in a special-purpose data management system. Measures are derived from the
records in the fact table and dimensions are derived from the dimension tables.

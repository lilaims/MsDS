-Cube is a shorthand for multidimensional dataset, given that data can have an arbitrary number of dimensions.
  The term hypercube is sometimes used, especially for data with more than three dimensions. 
    A cube is not a "cube" in the strict mathematical sense, as the sides are not all necessarily equal.

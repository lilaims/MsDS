GCP - Bigtable is neither OLAP (online analytical processing) or OLTP (online transaction processing)â€”both of which are SQL-based systems.
Bigtable is a NoSQL database. BigQuery is Google's OLAP offering.

?OLAP vs OLTP

OLTP is great for handling and storing multiple streams of transactions in databases. However, it cannot perform complex queries from the database. Therefore, business analysts use an OLAP system to analyze multidimensional data. For example, data scientists connect an OLTP database to a cloud-based OLAP cube to perform compute-intensive queries on historical data.

=======================================================



OLAP - cube technology
    - uses the hypercube concept

-Cube is a shorthand for multidimensional dataset, given that data can have an arbitrary number of dimensions.
  The term hypercube is sometimes used, especially for data with more than three dimensions. 
    A cube is not a "cube" in the strict mathematical sense, as the sides are not all necessarily equal. 
-A Slice is a term for a subset of the data, generated by picking a value for one dimension and only showing the data for that value

**
OLAP data is typically stored in a star schema or snowflake schema in a relational data 
warehouse or in a special-purpose data management system. Measures are derived from the
records in the fact table and dimensions are derived from the dimension tables.

Working 
 1. The OLAP server collects data from multiple data sources, including relational databases and data warehouses.
 2. Then, the extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools clean, aggregate, precalculate, and store data in an OLAP cube according to the number of dimensions specified.
 3. Business analysts use OLAP tools to query and generate reports from the multidimensional data in the OLAP cube.
 4. OLAP uses Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) to query the OLAP cube. MDX is a query, like SQL, that provides a set of instructions for manipulating databases.

Types
MOLAP
Multidimensional online analytical processing (MOLAP) involves creating a data cube that represents multidimensional data from a data warehouse. The MOLAP system stores precalculated data in the hypercube. Data engineers use MOLAP because this type of OLAP technology provides fast analysis. 

ROLAP
Instead of using a data cube, relational online analytical processing (ROLAP) allows data engineers to perform multidimensional data analysis on a relational database. In other words, data engineers use SQL queries to search for and retrieve specific information based on the required dimensions. ROLAP is suitable for analyzing extensive and detailed data. However, ROLAP has slow query performance compared to MOLAP. 

HOLAP
Hybrid online analytical processing (HOLAP) combines MOLAP and ROLAP to provide the best of both architectures. HOLAP allows data engineers to quickly retrieve analytical results from a data cube and extract detailed information from relational databases.

Use OLAP When:

Your data is primarily structured and fits well into a relational schema.
Data accuracy, consistency, and integrity are crucial for your application.
You need complex analytical capabilities, ad-hoc querying, and reporting on well-defined, structured data.
Use NoSQL When:

Your data is unstructured, semi-structured, or rapidly evolving.
You require horizontal scalability to handle massive volumes of data and high read/write throughput.
Schema flexibility is essential for accommodating changing data requirements.
Cost-efficiency and the ability to scale on commodity hardware are significant considerations.
In some scenarios, hybrid approaches are also employed, where both OLAP and NoSQL databases are used in conjunction to leverage the strengths of each technology for different aspects of the analytical processing pipeline. The choice ultimately depends on the specific requirements and nature of your data and analytical workloads.

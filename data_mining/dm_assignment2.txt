a) What is the advantage of using the Apriori algorithm in comparison with computing the support of every subset of an itemset in order to find the frequent itemsets in a transaction dataset
Breadth first search optimization
Pruning

-------------
b) b. [pen&paper] - Let 𝐿1 denote the set of frequent 1-itemsets. For 𝑘 ≥2 why must every frequent 𝑘-itemset be a superset of an itemset in 𝐿1?


-------------
c) c. [pen&paper] - Let 𝐿2={{1,2},{1,4},{2,3},{2,4},{3,5}}. Compute the set of candidates 𝐶3that is obtained by joining every pair of joinable itemsets from 𝐿2.
{[(1,2),(2,3)],[(1,2),(1,4)],[(1,4),(2,4)],[(2,3),(2,4)],[(2,3),(3,5)]}

{{1,2,3},{1,2,4},{2,3,4}{2,3,5}}

eliminate datasets that are not frequent
-------------
d) d. [pen&paper] - Let 𝑆1 denote the support of the association rule:

{𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡}⇒{𝑓𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡}
Let 𝑆2 denote the support of the association rule: {𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠} ⇒ {𝑓𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡} What is the relationship between 𝑆1 and 𝑆2?

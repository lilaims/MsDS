a) What is the advantage of using the Apriori algorithm in comparison with computing the support of every subset of an itemset in order to find the frequent itemsets in a transaction dataset

b) b. [pen&paper] - Let 𝐿1 denote the set of frequent 1-itemsets. For 𝑘 ≥2 why must every frequent 𝑘-itemset be a superset of an itemset in 𝐿1?

c) c. [pen&paper] - Let 𝐿2={{1,2},{1,4},{2,3},{2,4},{3,5}}. Compute the set of candidates 𝐶3that is obtained by joining every pair of joinable itemsets from 𝐿2.
{[(1,2),(2,3)],[(1,2),(1,4)],[(1,4),(2,4)],[(2,3),(2,4)],[(2,3),(3,5)]}

{{1,2,3},{1,2,4},{2,3,4}{2,3,5}}

d) d. [pen&paper] - Let 𝑆1 denote the support of the association rule:

{𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠,𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡}⇒{𝑓𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡}
Let 𝑆2 denote the support of the association rule: {𝑏𝑜𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠} ⇒ {𝑓𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡} What is the relationship between 𝑆1 and 𝑆2?

The relationship between the support values s1 and s2 in association rules can be expressed in terms of set inclusion. Specifically:
s1≥s2

The support of an association rule represents the proportion of transactions in the dataset that contain all the items in the rule. In this context:

�
1
s1 is the support of the association rule {boarding pass, passport} => {flight}.
�
2
s2 is the support of the association rule {boarding pass} => {flight}.
Since the first rule ({boarding pass, passport} => {flight}) has a more specific condition by including both "boarding pass" and "passport," any transaction that satisfies the first rule will also satisfy the second rule ({boarding pass} => {flight}). Therefore, the support of the first rule 
�
1
s1 cannot be smaller than the support of the second rule 
�
2
s2. In other words, the support of the rule with more items in the antecedent (left-hand side) is always greater than or equal to the support of the rule with fewer items in the antecedent.

This relationship holds because the more items you require in the antecedent, the more specific and restrictive the rule becomes, and the fewer transactions will satisfy it.

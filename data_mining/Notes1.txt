Association mining


-----------------------
Outlier  & Outlier detection
Parametric - Mahalnobis distance for point and distribution(known)
Clustering - kmeans clustering, points outside cluster, distribution unkown
Classification- one class SVM - point and normal distribution, distribution : normal

Conceptual , statistical outliers

why do we need to detect outliers

-----------------------
Web crawlers - getting urls recursively using bfs
The behavior of a Web crawler is the outcome of a combination of policies:[7]

a selection policy which states the pages to download,
a re-visit policy which states when to check for changes to the pages,
a politeness policy that states how to avoid overloading Web sites.
a parallelization policy that states how to coordinate distributed web crawlers.

Data harvesting

-----------------------
search engine indexing and ranking
use web crawlers to get url , data , metadata , images
group based on similarity of data , metadata, images
rank the grouping relative to similarity between search vector

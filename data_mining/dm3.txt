Association rule mining / association analysis
 - market basket analysis, customer segmentation, and fraud detection.
 - based on frequent data in the variables


Market Basket Analysis
  -mining frequent itemsets & generate rules from frequent itemsets found in a database : Apriori Frequent Itemset (breadth first)
  -algorithms for mining frequent itemsets :Eclat(Depth first) AND FP-Growth (Divide and conquer)
  - maximal and closed itemsets
  - Sequential Pattern Mining: GSP (Generalized Sequential Pattern) and SPADE 
  - Multi-level Association Rule Mining:

-------------------------------------
Association rule mining is a technique used to uncover hidden relationships between variables in large datasets


   apriori
   -transaction table , itemset table , candidate set 
  - support count , Confidence

association rules
 if then statements
 single anticedent , multiple anticedent , multiple consequent
 using metrics to evaluate the significance of association rules
 support count , Confidence, lift', 'leverage', 'conviction', or 'zhangs_metric'


- transaction encoder - presence or absence of items

Association rule mining / association analysis
 - market basket analysis, customer segmentation, and fraud detection.
 - based on frequent data in the variables


Market Basket Analysis
  -mining frequent itemsets & generate rules from frequent itemsets found in a database : Apriori Frequent Itemset (breadth first)
  -algorithms for mining frequent itemsets :Eclat(Depth first) AND FP-Growth (Divide and conquer)
  - maximal and closed itemsets
  - Sequential Pattern Mining: GSP (Generalized Sequential Pattern) and SPADE 
  - Constraint-Based Association Rule Mining
  - Multi-level Association Rule Mining:
  - Quantitative Association Rule Mining:
may be variations or combinations of these methods in practice. The choice of the algorithm depends on 
factors such as the dataset characteristics, computational efficiency, and the specific goals of the analysis
-------------------------------------
Association rule mining is a technique used to uncover hidden relationships between variables in large datasets


   apriori
   -transaction table , itemset table , candidate set 
  - support count , Confidence

association rules
 if then statements
 single anticedent , multiple anticedent , multiple consequent
 using metrics to evaluate the significance of association rules
 support count , Confidence, lift', 'leverage', 'conviction', or 'zhangs_metric'


- transaction encoder - presence or absence of items

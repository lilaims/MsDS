----------------------------
Random Sampling - through random number generators, every population has equal chance
Stratified - population divided into subgroups based on characteristic , equal random sampling is done for all groups
ystematic Sampling:

Selecting every kth individual from a list after randomly choosing a starting point.
For example, selecting every 10th person from a list of 100.
Cluster Sampling:

The population is divided into clusters, and entire clusters are randomly selected.
Within the chosen clusters, all individuals are included in the sample.
Convenience Sampling:

Selecting individuals who are easiest to reach or readily available.
While convenient, this method may introduce bias as it doesn't ensure a representative sample.
Snowball Sampling:

Participants are used to recruit more participants.
Often used in situations where the population is hard to reach.
Quota Sampling:

Similar to stratified sampling but non-random.
Researchers select a certain number of individuals from different categories until the quota is filled.
Purposive or Judgmental Sampling:

Researchers choose participants based on their judgment about who would be most appropriate for the study.
Common in qualitative research.
Random Stratified Sampling:

A combination of simple random sampling and stratified sampling.
Random samples are taken from each stratum.
Multistage Sampling:

Involves multiple stages of sampling, often incorporating different methods.
For example, randomly selecting schools, then classes, and finally students.

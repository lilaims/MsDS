 - Parametric :  observations that do not fit the overall distribution of the data
 - Proximity : k nearest neighbhor (data distribution is unknown or multidimensional)
 - Classification : One-Class SVM create a model to describe the 'normal' data and classify points
        that fall outside this model as outliers

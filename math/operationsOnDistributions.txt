Additions of two distributions
P(A)+P(B) = Iteg(f(x)g(t-x)dx)

Note that this convolution operation can be computationally expensive, especially for continuous distributions. 
In practice, convolutions are often calculated using numerical methods, especially when closed-form solutions 
are not readily available.

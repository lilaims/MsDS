~~Eigen Decomposition
 factorization of a matrix into a canonical form, whereby the matrix is represented in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
 Only diagonalizable matrices can be factorized in this way
~~SVD 
 In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. 
 It generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any m*n matrix

~~Linear Discriminant Analysis
a method used in statistics and other fields, to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events.
The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification.

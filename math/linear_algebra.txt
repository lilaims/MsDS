Inner Product Space : function that assigns a scalar value (real or complex) to any pair of vectors in the space. This function captures the notion of "closeness" or "similarity" between vectors.

~~Eigen Decomposition
 factorization of a matrix into a canonical form, whereby the matrix is represented in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
 Only diagonalizable matrices can be factorized in this way
~~SVD 
 In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. 
 It generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any m*n matrix

~~Linear Discriminant Analysis
a method used in statistics and other fields, to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events.
The resulting combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality reduction before later classification.

F <-> V <-- B
A basis B of a vector space V over a field F (such as the real numbers R or the complex numbers C) is a linearly independent subset of V that spans V. 
This means that a subset B of V is a basis if it satisfies the two following conditions:
1. linear independence
2. spanning property
The scalars ai are called the coordinates of the vector v with respect to the basis B, and by the first property they are uniquely determined.

A vector space that has a finite basis is called finite-dimensional. In this case, the finite subset can be taken as B itself to check for linear independence in the above definition.

------------------
Handcrafted --
 - Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG): Captures the distribution of intensity gradients in local image patches.
 - Local Binary Patterns (LBP): Describes the local texture pattern in an image.
 - Color Histograms: Represents the distribution of color in an image.
 - SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform): Detects and describes local features that are invariant to scale and rotation.

CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks
 - VGG, ResNet, Inception
 - Feature Extraction Layers: Extract features from intermediate layers of a pre-trained CNN.

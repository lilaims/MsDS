Gamma Functions (df=[(k=1,thet=2),(k=1,thet=2),(k=2,thet=1.5).....])
  exponential --> skewd normal -> normal --> skewed --> expoential
  k --> increasing
  theta --> decreasing

chi squared : sum of squares of k independent normal distributions
          usually used in tsting, not approximating distributions
  - k--> increasing
  - exponential to skewed normal

the gamma with k=1 and chi squared with k=1 give exponential distribution with rate parameter lambda = 1
